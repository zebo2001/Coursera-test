"I have always said I would not have been President had it not been for my experience in North Dakota."

"It was here that the romance of my life began."

"I grow very fond of this place, and it certainly has a desolate, grim beauty of its own, that has a curious fascination for me."

"The&nbsp;Bad&nbsp;Lands grade all the way from those that are almost rolling in character to those that are so fantastically broken in form and so bizarre in color as to seem hardly properly to belong&nbsp;this&nbsp;earth.</p>
